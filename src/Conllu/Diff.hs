-- Build a diff of CoNLL-U elements (documents, sentences, words). it
-- may show the diff (the print* functions return pairs of the
-- differing fields in two words) or return the word pairs for further
-- processing (the diff* functions). it expects paired sentences as
-- input, and a default pairing function is provided.
--
-- this module is useful for visualizing or debugging the processing
-- of CoNLL-U corpora. be sure that the sentences are well-paired, or
-- else it'll be -- as always -- garbage in, garbage out.
